This project explores how different market sentiments—**Extreme Greed, Greed, Fear, and Neutral**—influence trader behavior, profitability, trade size, and strategy. Using real-world trading data and statistical methods, we uncover actionable insights to design smarter, sentiment-aware trading strategies.

## 🎯 Objective

To explore the relationship between trader performance and market sentiment, uncover hidden patterns, and deliver insights that can drive smarter trading strategies.

---

**Steps Involved**:
- Data Collection
- Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical Testing (ANOVA, Chi-squared, Kruskal-Wallis)
- Insight Extraction
- Strategy Recommendation

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Greed sentiment** delivers the highest profit, even with lower win rates.
- **Extreme Greed** has the best win rate but smaller profits—likely due to cautious trade sizes.
- **SELL trades outperform BUY** during emotional markets (Fear, Greed).
- **BUY trades work better** in calm, Neutral conditions.
- **SUI coin** shows consistent profitability regardless of sentiment.
- **Neutral sentiment** sees the highest cross-margin usage (~80%), suggesting increased risk.
- Statistical tests confirm strong links between sentiment, PnL, trade size, and direction (p < 0.001).
